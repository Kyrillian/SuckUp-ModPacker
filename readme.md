# Suck Up! Mod Packer:

So you've created a banger custom character or level for [Suck Up!](https://playsuckup.com) ?
Now you want to share it with the world?

Well, the game does support community creations through curseforge, but the process for packing your mod was tedious and manual.

Not anymore!
    
## What's it do?
This nifty little tool presents you with a GUI that lists all your custom characters and levels.
You simply select whatever you want to make into a modbundle, click the corresponding "Create a modpack" button and the mod packer does the rest.

### Character Packing
The mod packer creates a zip-file with the correct folder structure of a single character, ready for upload to curseforge.

### Level Packing
The mod packer creates, you've guessed it, a zip-file. It automatically includes every referenced custom character so the file is also ready for upload to curseforge.

## How to use it?
